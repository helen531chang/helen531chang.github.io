        <h2>Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?
        </h2>
        <p>The biggest problem my partner and I encountered while working on the project was getting our falling sprites to fall at random times instead of going at the same time. We solved this problem by searching up ways other scratch games had scripted the falling objects and went on from there.</p>
        <h2>What aspects of your game do you like best?</h2>
        <p>The aspect of our game that I liked best was the background and sprites as it brings back the memories from our childhood.</p>
        <h2>If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?
        </h2>
        <p>If more time was given to work on our game, I would fix the problem where, at times, the score would not change after touching a falling object.</p>
