        <h1>Aztec Run</h1>
        <center><font size="5"><p>Aztec Run is a single-player game where the goal is to catch as many coins as you can while simultaneously dodging the evil snails. </p></font></center>

        <h2>Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.</h2>
        <p>A programming algorithm my partner and I learned in the unit that we applied to our game was the forever loop that allowed the main sprite (Aztec) to move whenever the left or right arrow was pressed. We also implemented the if-then statements so if the left arrow was pressed, then the Aztec would move to the left, and if the right arrow was pressed, then the Aztec would move to the right.</p>
        <h2>Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?
        </h2>
        <p>One of the problems my partner and I encountered while working on the project was haivng our falling objects drop at random times instead of dropping at the same time. We solved this problem by searching up other scratch games algorithms that had scripted the falling objects and also asked Ms. Nguyen for help.</p>
        <h2>What aspects of your game do you like best?</h2>
        <p>The aspect of our game that I liked best was the background and sprites as they brought back childhood memories and are also very cute.</p>
        <h2>If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?
        </h2>
        <p>If more time was given to work on our game, I would fix the problem where, at times, the score would not change after touching a falling object.</p>
